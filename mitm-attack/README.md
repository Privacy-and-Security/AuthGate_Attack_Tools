## Introduction
This Chrome extension is designed to intercept and display the payment information submitted by users. 

This tool serves as a demonstrative proof of concept, highlighting the risks associated with transmitting payment details in plain text over the front end. It effectively illustrates the vulnerability of such information to Man in The Middle (MITM) attacks, where sensitive data can be easily intercepted or altered by unauthorized entities. 

This extension is a critical part of our security analysis, underscoring the importance of robust encryption methods to safeguard user data during online transactions.
